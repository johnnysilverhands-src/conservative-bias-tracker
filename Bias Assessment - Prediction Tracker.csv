Didn't even take more than six weeks or so and we have a great observation analysis of a (THE) major ocean current having changed fundamentally, in the past. Not just flickering towards new behavior, no a full regime shift that has set in, and been missed by consensus. The sudden loss of Antarctic sea ice makes sense now, and we have a behavior against existing modeling. And this has been happening for 10 years without publication. So we're wrong, we've been wrong, and we've been so wrong that entire continents have changed without us know. And the only people who predicted? Us. Because we corrected for bias. Because we are being abductive and proactive, and not deductive and reactive. Our heuristics can allow full on specific prediction, entirely because we can look at a system and compensate for the unknown. We can anticipate values, and do so in a directionally correct way, by assuming science itself has flaws. Want to see me do it again? The most likely reason this reversal has happened is because the studies on AMOC weakening are correct. Freshwater inputs from the poles are driving changes down the entire length of the current, and have been doing so for many decades. What is happening now is best likened to an ongoing cascade, not a flickering or regime shift. Each part of the system is now being changed, actively, in function driven by accelerations in other parts of the system. We have framed the future wrong here claiming one tipping point or another is 'the collapse' when in point of fact the entire system is already losing and changing capacity in great fashion. Sea currents are tightly coupled, and so are sea ice/basin depths/air flow. We can now trace changes from top to bottom of earth in this current, which means all the other currents are the same. This isn't 'the first to go', this is just the one we watch most closely so its the first we noticed. They ALL are like this. Any predictive timeframes that don't account for >15% weakening and fast couplings is wrong.",https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2500440122,10,TRUE

180,-Network dysfunction will accelerate human systems cascades. The core pathway is node consolidation (think USWEST1) + skill consolidation (MSPs) > increased importance of concentrated nodes > loss of node > more widespread dysfunction,,,,,5,FALSE

184,"-firing of analog workers means when digital systems fall, many cannot revert to 1980 behavior. If data streams cannot be brought back up, dysfunction will be worldwide, not national/regional/local",,,,,5,FALSE

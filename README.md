# conservative-bias-tracker
Institutional optimization against Type 1 errors has exploded Type 2 problem space.  Unassessed multi-domain interactions have hidden an ongoing cascade in earth and human systems.  Bias assessment of empirical observation vs institutional/theoretical forecasts reveals a consistent normalcy bias and emerging compounding accelerations.

## Overview

This repository documents systematic conservative bias in climate change predictions through analysis of 272 empirical observations comparing forecasted versus actual outcomes across multiple domains: atmospheric science, ocean dynamics, biosphere changes, societal impacts, and more.

## Key Findings

### Bias Drift Over Time

![Bias Drift Over Time](bias-drift-chart.png)

**Summary Statistics:**
- **Average bias magnitude**: 205.5%
- **Median bias magnitude**: 60%
- **Events occurring faster than predicted**: 113 (41.5%)
- **Events worse than predicted**: 230 (84.6%)
- **High transformative significance (3-4 rating)**: 148 (54.4%)

**Trend Analysis:**
The chart above reveals concerning patterns:
- **Median bias** has remained relatively stable (40-100%), suggesting consistent underestimation
- **Mean bias** shows extreme volatility, spiking to nearly 300% in 2025
- The divergence between mean and median indicates an increasing frequency of extreme bias events
- Conservative predictions are systematically failing to capture acceleration in climate impacts

## Methodology

### Bias Calculation

Bias percentage calculated as:
```
Bias % = |(Forecasted Value - Observed Value) / Forecasted Value| × 100%
```

For temporal predictions:
```
Bias % = |(Predicted Date - Actual Date) / Time Since Prediction| × 100%
```

### Verification Standards

- **Primary sources** prioritized (academic journals, government reports)
- **Cross-validation** required for transformative significance ratings of 3-4
- **Conservative scoring** applied when evidence is ambiguous
- **Multiple sources** cited for controversial claims

## Notable Patterns

### Systematic Underestimation

1. **Atmospheric warming**: 2°C milestone predicted for 2040-2050, observations suggest 2026-2029 (70%+ bias)
2. **Ocean heat content**: Earth Energy Imbalance (EEI) 2x higher than CMIP6 projections (100% bias)
3. **Methane emissions**: Arctic releases discovered decades ahead of schedule (280% bias)
4. **Ecosystem collapse**: Insect populations declining 2-5% annually vs. predicted 1-2% (100% bias)
5. **AMOC collapse**: Probability before 2050 now 50-90% vs. "unlikely before 2100" (200+ years bias)

### Categories with Highest Bias

- **Ocean dynamics**: Mean bias 140%
- **Cryosphere changes**: Mean bias 160%
- **Chemical/pollution impacts**: Mean bias 180%

## Usage

### Downloading the Data
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/climate-bias-analysis.git

# Navigate to directory
cd climate-bias-analysis
```

### Basic Analysis (Python)
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('climate-bias-data.csv')

# Calculate summary statistics
print(f"Mean bias: {df['Magnitude of bias %'].mean():.1f}%")
print(f"Median bias: {df['Magnitude of bias %'].median():.1f}%")

# Events by category
category_counts = df['File Location'].str.split('/').str[0].value_counts()
print(category_counts)

# Faster/Worse analysis
faster = df['Faster?'].sum()
worse = df['Worse?'].sum()
print(f"Faster: {faster}, Worse: {worse}")
```

### Filtering High-Impact Events
```python
# Get transformative events (rated 3 or 4)
transformative = df[df['Transformative Significance (# out 4)'].isin([3, 4])]

# Events with >100% bias
extreme_bias = df[df['Magnitude of bias %'] > 100]

# Recent observations (2024-2025)
recent = df[df['Date'].isin([2024, 2025])]
```

## Implications

This analysis suggests:

1. **Systematic conservative bias** across multiple scientific domains
2. **Accelerating divergence** between predictions and reality (2022-2025)
3. **Institutional blind spots** regarding nonlinear tipping points
4. **Underestimated timelines** for critical thresholds (1.5°C, 2°C, AMOC collapse)

### Why This Matters

Conservative bias in climate science creates a **false sense of security**:
- Policy decisions based on outdated timelines
- Inadequate adaptation planning
- Underestimation of cascading risks
- Delayed emergency response mechanisms

## Limitations

- **Selection bias**: Focus on cases where bias exists
- **Measurement uncertainty**: Some bias calculations involve estimates
- **Publication lag**: Recent events may not yet have peer-reviewed analysis
- **Complexity**: Interconnected systems resist simple bias calculations
